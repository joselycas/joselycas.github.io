When I first signed up to the Flatiron program I was scared. I though to myself I was never good at math, I hate soduku, and I am not good at crossword puzzles. These are all skills I read a programmers needed to be successful. I am one project away from completing the course, and I still suck at crossword puzzles. 

I realized everyone is different when becomming a programmer. For instance, I had to reread lessons, watch videos, and ask tons of questions to the instructors. I felt like this was making me a bad programmer, but in reality the extra effort and help went a long way. 

Approaching programming with an open-mind is hard, but necessary. All problems in programming are solveable, and anything can be built the same way but with different approaches. There is no ONE way of programming. When I became comfortable with this approach, I became more confident. I was not afraid to try new things, broke my code and put it back together to get the full understanding. Grasping the concepts of each language and framework is the most important, not being an expery mathmatician.
