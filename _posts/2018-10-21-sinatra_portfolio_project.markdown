This portion of the course really helped put Full-Stack into perspective. Sinatra covers many important aspects of development. I learned how to work with CRUD, Restful routes and how to create secured login credentials. ActiveRecord and other gems makes the development of apps effortless. When creating my app for this project I thought about information that I constantly update. I have many friends who contact me asking where in the world I am. They always make plans to visit me but my routes tend to change more often than not. I thought a shareable travel app would be good to keep them informed of where I am and where I am going. 

## Organzing my thoughts to fit the MVC model
When working on my project I found it useful to break everything up to digestable pieces by organizing information to fit the MVC format. For models I thought of the classes and relationships I needed to establish and get connected. I thought of the different forms and views I want my users to see when using the app. I thought about the actions my contollers need to take to get everything working. Getting a good understanding of the SInatra section, especially MVC and how they all work together really helped put this project into motion.
