Putting together an app is overwhelming. You have to think about many aspects of your app such as the structure, database and layout. The best way to handle big projects like this is to break them up and use programs to help map out what is needed. 

I found these tools super helpful for designing an app:

* Excel - I used this to map out my database. I listed the tables I needed and the attributes. Helped me pass this information along to tech coaches as well. 
* [Wire Frame CC](https://wireframe.cc/)  - this helped me visualize the design I wanted for my app. Very simple to use 
* Color Pickr - a chrome add-on that is super useful for selecting web colors. 
* Image size - a chrome add-on that is super helpful sizing images off the web. 
* [Canva ](https://www.canva.com/q/pro/?v=11&utm_source=google_sem&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_US_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Core_EM&utm_term=REV_US_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Canva_EM&gclid=CjwKCAjwkenqBRBgEiwA-bZVtuUpS-MS677_naaywVKfd5cyFHIwVp7emp_Am3-Q1ikbB3WxYovDdxoCC1kQAvD_BwE)- helps design images for header images and web page images.

Best thing of all, they are all free to use.
