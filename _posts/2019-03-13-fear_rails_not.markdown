Rails was challenging, but not as challenging as learning Ruby on it's own. Unlike Ruby, Rails is the framework that made the programming language Ruby make sense. 

Never thought I'd say this, but I actually like Rails. It's like magic that you have to understand. Once you know how methods, form and link helpers work, there are so many resources at your fingertips. 

My project was complicated, because I made it that way, not intentionally. I always have a hard time figuring out exactly what I want to build and how. Thankfully many students and tech coaches landed a hand to help me figure out how my data would make best sense. 

I started the project by buiding out my tables, later I built the assoications in the models, what I wanted to see in the views and later the logic in the controllers to make it all happen. Things broke and I later fixed them. This kindof worked for me because I was able to focus on the things that broke instead of building each MVC seperately. Using this approach I was able to visualize how my controllers should behave to give me the output I was looking for.
