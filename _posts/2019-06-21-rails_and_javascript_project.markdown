It was nice to have the chance to enhance my previously created rails app for this project. The process at times was a bit frustrating but the available resources made it manageable. Javascript is a language, that like rails, I feared. Functions, what? But in all it is not soo complicated. Once you grasp the idea that functions are there to make your app perform unique tasks, enhancing functionality can be endless. Just like rails, JS has methods that may seem to overlap doing the same functions. Such as iterating through arrays and constructing objects. Witht this project you can see everything you learned thus far come together. Including HTML and Object Orientation.
