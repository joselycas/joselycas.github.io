At first this project can seem intimidating. It is meant to encapsulate everything you learned in Object Oriented Ruby. But in reality, everything makes sense once you start to build it out. 

The toughest part for me was figuring out what kind of data I wanted to scrape. I have so many passions and ideas, so choosing a website with friendly scraping capabilities was a bit challenging. Once I found the perfect site it was game on. 

The lesson for this assessment provides good resources to use as you are working on your project. I highly advise to watch the code along videos and look at the project examples that are given. They help with the folder structure and make sense of what exactly it is you have to do. 
The 1:1 discussions are very useful too. 

Huge takeaway from this project: Donâ€™t be afraid to use the resources available, you will learn a lot more and you will find there is always a better way to get a task done.
