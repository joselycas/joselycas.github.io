Two years and two months later I am working on submitting my final project. It took some time as life gets in the way, ultimately timing means nothing as long as you keep your memory fresh of the courses in this program. 

The excitement of seeing "Hello World" from the intro to Ruby Development course was ineveitable. This has been a journey, but with this final Redux project seeing everything I learned come together is even more rewarding. 

The final project put all of my skills to test. Building the skeletons using create-rails-app and create-react-app laid the files and folders needed, but it was up to me to add logic into them. It was not the easiest tasks, and there were days I wanted to give up, even though I came this far. But I did not give up, I kept coding. 

There are many tools programmers use, from developing their app concept to debugging tools. These tools are essential to make your code work, without them you will accomplish nothing. Debugging tools made me feel confident with what I was building was working. Bootstrap is another tool I used to visually make my app more appealing. It is nice to know that most of the time you dont have to recreate the wheel. There were developers with the same frustration as me, and they built gems and packages to get things done more effeciently.
